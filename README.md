It is a game where you can play against an AI opponent that uses the minimax algorithm to make its moves. The game prompts the player to enter their move as a number from 0 to 8, corresponding to the positions on the board (starting from the top-left corner). The AI opponent will then make its move and the game continues until there is a winner or a tie.
