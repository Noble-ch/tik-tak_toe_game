# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with AI Opponent

A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can challenge yourself against an AI opponent that leverages the powerful Minimax algorithm for strategic moves.

## How to Play

- The game prompts the player to enter their move as a number from 0 to 8, representing the positions on the board (starting from the top-left corner).
- The AI opponent, driven by the Minimax algorithm, then calculates its optimal move.
- The game continues until there's a winner or a tie.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Artificial Intelligence (Minimax Algorithm)

## Purpose

This project was created as part of the Python and Artificial Intelligence bootcamps offered by Dev Town, providing hands-on experience and learning opportunities.
